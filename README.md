Linear Regression Project: House Price Prediction
This project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression to predict house prices based on multiple factors such as area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, and parking spaces.

 Dataset
The dataset contains information about different properties, with the following features:
Numerical Features: area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking
Target Variable: price

Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

 Project Workflow
Loaded and explored the dataset.
Selected relevant features for prediction.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Built and trained a Linear Regression model.
Evaluated the model using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
Interpreted the model's coefficients to understand feature impact.
(Optional) Visualized predictions when using a single feature.


 Results
The model successfully predicts house prices based on selected features with good accuracy, as measured by evaluation metrics.

 Future Improvements
Add encoding for categorical variables like mainroad, guestroom, etc.
Try feature scaling for better performance.
Explore other regression models (like Ridge, Lasso, or Decision Trees) for comparison.
